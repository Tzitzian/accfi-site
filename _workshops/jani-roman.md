Systemic constellation is an action based method to investigate and understand human systems. We can use it to develop the dynamics of an organization, but also to develop brands and products or also in recruiting processes.
 
The method has been lately researched in many countries and the results are very promising. We can state that it gives trustworthy diagnosis of the dynamics of an organization or how its stakeholders are relating to each other.
 
In this workshop I will show you, with your help, how this method works and how to use it to solve problems related to human systems.
