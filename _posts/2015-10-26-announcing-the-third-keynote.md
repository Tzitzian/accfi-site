We are delighted to announce that Chris Matts will join as as our third keynote speaker.

[**Chris Matts**](/speakers/#chris-matts) is a programme manager/project manager/business analyst who specialises in delivering trading and risk management systems in investment banks. He was involved in BDD in the early days. Dan North and Chris developed the “GIVEN-WHEN-THEN” template together. Since then he has been working on Feature Injection. Whilst BDD provides a neat interface between the business and the development team, Feature Injection helps the business prepare a comprehensive set of examples to feed the BDD machine. Whilst looking to price the option that exist naturally in an Agile development process Chris tripped over Real Options. He will be sharing his wisdom to inspire us as our third keynote speaker.
