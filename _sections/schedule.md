Friday we spend on prescheduled workshops / discussion themes. You are welcome to join any of the 3-5 sessions we are setting up.

* Diana Larsen: Agile Chartering
* Llewellyn Falco: Technical Coaching in Mob format
* Simo Routarinne: Status Facilitation
* Jani Roman: Systemic Constellations

Saturday whole day until Sunday 12.00 is Open Space. We co-create the program from the contributions of the participants and can discuss any topics people volunteer for the program in the spirit of open space.

We break regularly to enjoy the wonderful foods of Herrankukkaro, and enjoy evenings of challenging discussions with each other around the smoke sauna and hot tubs, walks in the great neighborhood or just hangout places around the premises.
