title: What is Open Space?
---



We've all had those ‘magic moments’ at a conference where you meet the right person and have a wonderful  conversation that is just perfect for you.

Open space conferences are focus around having more of these moments.

####How can we increase serendipity?

It might seem odd to say we can increase luck. But that exactly what we are here to do. Open space does everything possible to increase your chances of having magic moments. We know that they are here, and together we can find them.

Here’s some of the things we do:

<div class="one-fourth">
  <h4>More opportunities</h4>

  <p>Lot’s of spaces & Time
  More opportunities to
  Find insights & people
   you need</p>

</div>
<div class="one-fourth">
  <h4>Broadcast topics of interest</h4>
  <img src="/images/marketplace.png"/>
  <p>Unlike normal conferences,
  at open space you can say<br/>
  “I’m interested ____”
   and explore that area with others</p>
</div>

<div class="one-fourth">

  <h4>Encourage movement</h4>

  <p>The right session is there, you just have to find it. Open spaces encourage you to move
      from session to session until you find the right place</p>

</div>

<div class="one-fourth">

  <h4>People</h4>
  <img src="/images/people.png"/>
  <p>Small groups of the right people allow for real and close connections to form. Open spaces put effort into making it effortless to connect to each other.</p>
