title: What is ACCFI?
---

Agile Coach Camp Finland is the weekend retreat of brilliant, experienced minds building knowledge together. Coach Camp brings together coaches, consultants and seniors to share in the form of an open space.

The event takes place in the beautiful Herrankukkaro in Turku Archipelago area (Naantali). The location is known for it’s beauty, unique setting (have you ever stayed in a bird cottage or a grandma cottage -framed room? Ever tried the world’s largest smoke sauna? Herrankukkaro is your change for these) and great quality food that provides us the perfect location to build our ideas forward. The location alone is worth a “weekend with friends” for the price of the event we’re setting up. The place has been selected with the idea that it’s the greatest place to welcome our foreign coach friends for a weekend in Finland.

ACCFI will bring together people who are, with their work, helping others get better in their thinking and doing, such as tech coaches / tech seniors; agile coaches / scrum masters / managers; organizational / business coaches / general coaches. *You* are welcome to join us for in-depth discussions about developing software, people and organizations.
