The price of the weekend is 350 euros and it includes the event from Friday to Sunday, stay at Herrankukkaro in shared rooms (2-4 people), foods and transportation from Helsinki or Turku to Herrankukkaro.

[Herrankukkaro](http://herrankukkaro.visualizer360.com/) is a beautiful, isolated fisherman village style retreat location reserved specially for us for the weekend. It's located in Turku Archipelago area (Naantali). The location is known for it’s beauty, unique setting (have you ever stayed in a bird cottage or a grandma cottage -framed room? Ever tried the world’s largest smoke sauna? Herrankukkaro is your chance for these) and great quality food that provides us the perfect location to build our ideas forward. The location alone is worth a “weekend with friends” for the price of the event we’re setting up. The place has been selected with the idea that it’s the greatest place to welcome our foreign coach friends for a weekend in Finland.

This event will fit 120 participants, so book your spot soon to join the event!
